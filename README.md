# MVP3 Revamp

A multi-agent path planning and coordination system with real-time vision processing and simulation capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project is developed and tested under **Python 3.12**. It provides a comprehensive system for multi-robot coordination, featuring both simulation and real-world modes with real-time camera vision processing.

It supports two execution modes:
- **Simulation Mode** - Virtual environment for testing algorithms without hardware
- **Real-World Mode** - Live camera input with actual robot coordination

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.12**
- **Camera** (for real-world mode): 720  1280 resolution
- **Operating System**: Windows

### Dependencies

All required packages are listed in 
equirements.txt. Key dependencies include:
- PyQt6 - GUI framework
- OpenCV - Vision processing
- ZMQ - Network communication
# MVP3 Revamp

MVP3 Revamp is a prototype system for multi-robot path planning, vision-based localization, and coordinated control. It supports both simulation and real-hardware modes and is intended for algorithm validation and small-robot integration.

Key features
- Multi-robot path planning and collision avoidance (MRPP, RVO2, etc.)
- Real-time ArUco-based localization from a camera, published over ZMQ
- PyQt6 GUI with simulation and real-hardware modes
- Serial communication and robot command framing

Quick Start
1. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended with conda):

```bash
conda create -n MVP3_1 python=3.12 -y
conda activate MVP3_1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the GUI in simulation mode (no hardware required):

```bash
python qt_gui.py -s
```

3. Run the GUI in real-hardware mode (camera and robots required):

```bash
python qt_gui.py
```
Real-hardware setup (XIAO ESP32C6)

For real-world deployments we use Seeed XIAO ESP32C6 boards. One XIAO should act as the central signal sender and be connected directly to the PC via USB; flash that board with `xiao_ap_ESP_NOW.ino` from the `firmware/` folder. The remaining XIAO boards are installed on the robots — flash each robot's XIAO with `xiao_1_8_ESP_NOW.ino`. Adjust pin mappings in the sketches to match your hardware wiring. The system has been tested with around 10 robots operating concurrently. After the XIAO boards are flashed and the robots are powered, connect the camera and run the GUI (`python qt_gui.py`) to start the real-hardware experiment.

Real-hardware deployment (XIAO ESP32C6)

This project uses Seeed XIAO ESP32C6 boards for real-world experiments. Use one XIAO as the central transmitter connected directly to the PC via USB and flash it with `firmware/xiao_ap_ESP_NOW.ino`. Install the remaining XIAO boards on each robot and flash them with `firmware/xiao_1_8_ESP_NOW.ino`. Adjust the pin assignments in the sketches to match your wiring. The system has been tested to run stably with around 10 robots concurrently. After flashing the boards, powering the robots and connecting the camera, start the GUI with `python qt_gui.py` to begin the real-hardware experiment.


Project layout (summary)
- `qt_gui.py`: main GUI application (simulation and hardware modes)
- `vision_pub.py`: camera capture and ArUco detection, publishes positions via ZMQ
- `positionZMQSub.py`: subscribes to vision data and maintains robot states
- `comm.py`: serial communication and command framing
- `DDR.py`: differential-drive control logic
- `algorithms/`: path planning and avoidance algorithms (`mrpp.py`, `rvo2.py`, ...)
- `patterns/`: predefined movement patterns and examples
- `firmware/`: microcontroller firmware examples
- `projects/`: example projects and research code

Dependencies
- See `requirements.txt` for the full list (OpenCV, PyQt6, pyzmq, numpy, pyserial, etc.).

Optional Dependency: Gurobi (MRPP only)

- Gurobi Optimizer **13.0.1**
- Required only for MRPP (ILP-based multi-robot path planning)
- Not required for vision, GUI control, or formation demos

Development and contribution
- To add a new algorithm, place the module under `algorithms/` and add a test entry in the GUI.
- Issues and PRs are welcome—please include reproduction steps and configuration details.
